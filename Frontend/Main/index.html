                                    grease the parchment paper. Parchment paper helps the cakes seamlessly release from

                                    (I just
                                    boil a kettle of water.) Quickly place the cake on the center rack and shut the oven

                                    trapping steam inside. The steamy oven helps guarantee an extra moist cake.

                                    Bake for 30 minutes until the edges are set. The cake is done when a toothpick
                                    inserted into
                                    the center of the cake comes out clean OR comes out with just a few moist crumbs.
                                    It's
                                    important to not over-bake this cake, which dries it out. Begin checking it at 25
                                    minutes.
                                    Don't be alarmed if the cake rises extra tall around some of the edges and slightly
                                    cracks-
                                    this is normal (it's the eggs expanding) and will flatten out as it cools.

                                    it onto a serving plate or cake stand. (If it cools completely in the pan, it's very
                                    difficult to release from the pan.) Cake will be a little crumbly on the edges. Cool

                                    8 Inch Cake Pan: I recommend an 8-inch cake pan. A 9-inch cake pan works, but the
                                    cake is
                                    thinner. The bake time will be a couple minutes shorter in a 9-inch cake pan.

                                    fully cooled, about 2 hours. Run a knife around the edge
                                    of the cooled cheesecake, then release it from the springform
                                    pan.

                                    Make the glaze: In a small pot, heat the cream and corn syrup
                                    over medium heat. Place the milk chocolate into a small
                                    heat-safe bowl. When the cream comes to a boil, pour it over the
                                    chocolate. Let it sit for 15 seconds, untouched. Mix the ganache
                                    to combine, and pour immediately over the cheesecake. Let set
                                    before slicing and serving.

                                    Note: This recipe is for an ultra-tall New York-style cheesecake.
                                    You can halve the amounts for the cheesecake custard and glaze
                                    (keep the crust amount the same) for a more moderately sized
                                    cheesecake. Reduce the baking time to 45 minutes to 1 hour.
